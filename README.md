👋 Hi there! I’m Samuel, also known as @sanimations.

🎮 As an avid gamer and tech enthusiast, I love spending time with friends, diving into new games, and exploring the latest movies and TV shows.

💻 With a background in Film/Electronic Arts and extensive experience in web development, I'm proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, React Native, SQL, noSQL, MongoDB, and more.

🚀 I've built various web applications and projects, including a Pokédex app, a movie database with React, and a serverless Progressive Web App (PWA) using React and the Google Calendar API.

🤝 I’m always eager to collaborate on exciting projects and explore new opportunities. Whether it's coding a website or creating innovative gaming experiences, count me in!

📫 Feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate, discuss tech, or simply chat about games—I'm here to connect and create awesome things together!
